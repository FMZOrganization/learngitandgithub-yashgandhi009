# Github Basics

GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for software development and a community of developers to collaborate on and contribute to open-source projects. Here's a summary of my key learning from the document and also after referring some of the websites, documents and some videos:

Here are some basics of GitHub:

**Repository:** 
> A repository is a storage location for your project, which contains all the files, revisions, and history of the project.

**Issues:** 
> Issues are used to track bugs, feature requests, or any other project-related tasks.

**Pull Requests:** 
> Pull Requests allow developers to suggest changes to a project and have a conversation about those changes.

**Commits:** 
> A commit is a change that is saved to a repository. It includes a message describing the change and an identifier that links to the change in the repository history.

**Branches:** 
>Branches allow developers to work on different versions of a project simultaneously. The default branch is usually named "master".

**Forking:**
> Forking is the process of creating a copy of a repository under your own account. You can use a fork to make changes to a project without affecting the original repository.

**Markdown:**
> Markdown is a lightweight markup language used to format text on GitHub. It can be used in commit messages, pull request descriptions, and README files to add formatting and links.

#Here are some basic Git commands that are commonly used on GitHub:

**git clone:**
This command is used to copy a repository from a remote location to your local machine.
> Example: **`git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git`**


**git init:** 
This command is used to initialize a new Git repository in a local directory.
> Example: **`git init`**


**git add:**
This command is used to stage changes in a file for inclusion in a future commit.
> Example: **`git add file.txt`**

**git commit:**
This command is used to save changes to a repository's history.
> Example: **`git commit -m "Add file.txt"`**

**git push:** 
This command is used to send changes from a local repository to a remote repository.
> Example: **`git push origin master`**

**git pull:**
This command is used to retrieve changes from a remote repository and merge them into the local repository.
>Example: **`git pull origin master`**

**git branch:**
This command is used to create, list, or delete branches in a Git repository.
>Example: **`git branch new-branch`**

**git checkout:** 
This command is used to switch between branches in a Git repository.
>Example: **`git checkout new-branch`**

These are some of the most basic Git commands that you will use frequently when working with GitHub. Keep in mind that these are just the beginning and there are many more Git commands and features available to use.

There are many other features and tools available in GitHub, but these are some of the most important concepts to understand when getting started with the platform. These are the basic concepts of GitHub that help developers collaborate and contribute to open-source projects effectively, You can learn more about GitHub by visiting the official documentation at https://docs.github.com/en/.
